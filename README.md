<h1>Here is my Sample task for Wiredelta!</h1>

I created a small web application whihch allows you to organize your day in order to get the best use of it. This web-app has first top bar which always show you the actual date and the clock. It also includes a dropdown which allows the user to switch themes in order to have a greater experience. For example, let's say you are in the bed ready to fall asleep and want to look what are your task for tomorrow. First thing you can choose a dark theme which will make it pleasant for your eye and then start looking into tomorrows tasks (be aware, you want be able to take control of them until the clock hits 0:00).

Enjoy and get ready to have better and better days!
